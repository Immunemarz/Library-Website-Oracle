<h1 class = "peoplesaying">Students Create Software Program to Benefit Local School for the Blind</h1>


<img src="/static/Perkins.jpg" class = "perkins" alt = "picture of stonehill helping perkins students">

<p class = "perkinstext">Students from the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown are more independent thanks to a new fully accessible time tracking system designed 
and implemented by Stonehill students. Last semester, seven computer science majors along with two interdisciplinary studies majors concentrating in technology, 
worked on the project as part of their Senior Capstone. From coding the program to writing a 220 page user manual, the students developed every 
aspect of the project which allows Perkins' students to record their work and volunteer hours electronically. Over the summer, Matt Plummer '15 worked closely with Perkins on 
implementing the program, a tough but rewarding and practical learning experience. For more, visit <a href = "http://www.stonehill.edu/news-media/news/details/students-create-software-program-to-benefit-local-school-for-the-blind/">here.</a></p>


<h1 class = "peoplesaying">Stonehill Alumni Are Thriving on the Frontier of the Internet Economy</h1>

<img src="/static/index01.jpg" class = "techpic" alt = "picture of technology">

<p class="perkinstext">Jen Burge '04 is used to the Mark Zuckerberg question. A software engineer at Facebook for the past five years, 
it seems everyone who hears where she works wants to know if she's met the 30-year-old 
billionaire and Facebook founder. "I see him around campus occasionally," she usually replies, referring to the social media company's sprawling California headquarters.
Being at a high-profile company where the boss is famous might be what intrigues others but for Jen the thrill comes from being able to apply her computer 
science skills in a way that helps the stars in her own life. "My favorite thing about my job is getting to work on a product my friends and family use every day,
" Jen says. "I enjoy knowing that the stuff I do helps so many people stay connected with the people they care about."

<h1 class = "peoplesaying">Students Create Interactive Mobile Touring App</h1>

<img src="/static/gaido.jpg" class = "gaido" alt = "picture of the app they built">

<p class = "perkinstext">
As it looked for new ways of reaching prospective students, the Enrollment Management and Marketing Division approached computer 
science majors Ryan Curtis '10 and Scott Markoski '10 for ideas. 
The end result was Gaido, a one-of-a-kind touring application smart phone owners can utilize for unique, 
interactive experiences. <a href = "http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/Gaido.htm">Read More</a></p>
